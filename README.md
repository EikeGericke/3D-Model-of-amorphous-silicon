# 3D-Model-of-amorphous-silicon
This script is written to prepare cooordinates for a nanoscopic 3D model of 
hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H).
Besides this purpose the script can be used to 
randomly place grains defind by xyz coordinates in a pre defined volume.

This script is using batches of xyz coordinates defingin an aggregate. 
These aggregates are simulated using the following script:
